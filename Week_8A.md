# Week 8A: Exploring SIGGRAPH Topics with Generative AI

## Learning Objectives

- Comprehend the interdisciplinary nature of SIGGRAPH topics (e.g., computer graphics, HCI, AI, design, storytelling).
- Stimulate creative and applied thinking from a business or social innovation perspective.
- Practice visualizing abstract or technical concepts using Generative AI tools.
- Collaboratively develop and update this GitHub page with your team’s findings.

## Activity Overview

At SIGGRAPH, technology and art converge. How can you, as a creative technologist or future business strategist, make sense of these innovations?

### Step 1: Team Topic Selection

Choose one SIGGRAPH-related theme, such as:

- Real-Time Rendering  
- Neural Style Transfer  
- Generative Design  
- Motion Capture and AI  
- Interactive Storytelling  
- Virtual Humans / Digital Doubles  
- Environmental Simulation / Digital Nature  

---

### Step 2: Prompt Engineering with AI Tools

Use ChatGPT (or equivalent tools) to explore the following:

- What is [your selected topic]?
- How is it currently applied in industry?
- What are the ethical or business implications?
- Generate a possible application scenario using prompt-based interaction.

Example prompt:  
"Explain neural style transfer in simple terms, and generate a business case for using it in mobile social media applications."

### Step 3: Visualization and Application

Use image-generation tools such as DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion to:

- Visualize a concept, prototype, or experience tied to your topic.
- Include image prompts and outputs in your repository.

Optional tools: Canva, Figma, Blender

### Step 4: Documentation and Submission

Update your `Week8A_SIGGRAPH.md` file with the following:

1. Topic summary (written in your own words)  
2. AI-generated explanation (based on ChatGPT or similar output)  
3. AI-assisted visuals (include image prompt used)  
4. Business or social impact scenario  
5. Team reflection (What did your team learn?)
